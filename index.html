        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We envision a world where masculinity is not defined by rigid expectations, but rather by a commitment to personal growth, self-awareness, and respect for all. We believe that men can be strong and vulnerable, assertive and empathetic, competitive and collaborative, all at the same time.</p>
